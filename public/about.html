<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At this current moment, I am sitting in the sleeper berth of my big rig at a Love's Travel Stop in Rhome, TX.
  I've never been away from my son for more than a day in his 10 years on this earth.
  When he asked if he could come with, the only logical answer was yes. We won't be out on the road for more than 3 weeks.
  His mother (my wife) misses us more than a set of lungs misses oxygen after a 3 mile run.
  It's hard to imagine living on the road longer than absolutely necassary, but this economy 
  has changed the trajectory of our lives. I feel too old to start a new career, but 
  self-doubt wont get a soul to the promised land. I will do everything in my power to 
  get a career that allows me to be back home where I belong.
